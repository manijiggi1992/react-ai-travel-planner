Okay, here's a travel plan for Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, designed for a solo traveler on a budget for 1 day.  I'll provide JSON formatted data for hotels and the itinerary. I'll aim to maximize your experience while keeping costs down.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Budget:**  "Cheap" is subjective. I'm assuming a budget traveler is comfortable with hostels, budget hotels, and street food.  I'll aim for accommodation under ₹1500 (approximately $20 USD) per night, and focus on affordable transportation and activities.
*   **Transportation:** Mumbai traffic can be challenging.  I'll prioritize using the local train (a lifeline for Mumbaikars), buses, and auto-rickshaws (negotiate the fare!).
*   **Safety:**  Mumbai is generally safe, but be mindful of your belongings, especially in crowded areas.
*   **Time:** 1 day is a very short time to explore Mumbai. This itinerary will focus on key landmarks.

**Explanation and Tips:**

*   **Accommodation:**  I've included 3 options: A hotel in Fort, a Hostel in Colaba and a hotel in Colaba. Hostels are generally the cheapest option, great for meeting people. Hotels offer more privacy. Book in advance, especially during peak season.
*   **Transportation:**
    *   Local Train: The most efficient way to travel long distances. Buy a ticket at the station. It can be crowded!
    *   Taxis/Auto-rickshaws: Negotiate the fare beforehand.  Use ride-sharing apps like Uber or Ola for fixed fares.
    *   Buses:  Cheap, but can be confusing for first-timers.
*   **Food:** Street food is a must-try in Mumbai. Be mindful of hygiene. Stick to popular stalls with a high turnover.
*   **Flexibility:** This is a packed itinerary.  Don't be afraid to skip something if you're tired or want to spend more time at a particular place.
*   **Bargaining:** Bargain when shopping at Colaba Causeway.
*   **Photography:**  Mumbai is a very photogenic city.
*   **Respect Local Customs:** Dress modestly when visiting religious sites.

**Image URLs:**  I've used placeholder URLs (https://example.com/...).  Replace these with actual image URLs from Google Images, travel websites, or other sources.
**Important notes:**
*   The itinerary is highly packed to get most out of the visit.
*   Travel time may vary based on traffic.
*   Hotel prices may fluctuate based on availability and time.

This itinerary provides a solid foundation for your Mumbai trip. Enjoy your adventure!
